# Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?

# Answer - 
#  Cumulative density function is represents the Visualization of Cumulative Probability.
#  It will simply add the Previous Probabilities 
#  Cdf is used beaThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculates the cumulative probability for a given x-value. 

# Example - CDF(x) = P(X ≤ x)
# in the above example P(X ≤ x) is the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x.

# Use the CDF to determine the likelihood that a random observation taken from the population will be less than or equal to a particular value.
