# Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli
# Distribution and Binomial Distribution?

# Answer - 
# Bernauli distribution is the discrete distribution for a random variable which takes the value 1 for the probability p and takes the value 0 
# for the probability q = 1 - p and the outcomes are binary.

# Example - Tossing a Coin , student is pass or fail

# Sequence of outcomes of a bernauli's distribution is defined as the binomail distribution.
