# Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.

# There are 2 types of uniform distribution
# 1. Continuos uniform distribution
# 2. discrete uniform distribution

# 1. Continuos uniform distribution (CUD) - it is distribution describes the experiment where a arbitary overcomes is comes under a specific intervals and
# that has a minimum and maximum value of a and b.

# Example - The No. of candies sold daily at a shop is uniformly distributed with a maximum of 40 and minimum of 10 

# 2. Discrete Uniform distribution (DUF) - It is a Distribution which describes the Experiment where the finite number of overcomes equally likely to be happen.
