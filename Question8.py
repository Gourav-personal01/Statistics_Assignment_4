# What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.

# Answer - 

# Z score is method of coverting the normal distribution to standard normal distribution. we can also meansure the distance between the data points
# and the mean using standard deviation 

# Z score can be calculated by Z = (data points - Mean)/standard deviation

# It allows researchers to calculate the probability of a score occurring within a standard normal distribution
